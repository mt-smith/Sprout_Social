-- SQLite Query for Sprout Social Part 1

/*
Uncomment this code block to drop records from respective tables.
The customer_table is the primary key for customer_id fields and has 783 distinct customer_ids
The customer_logins table has 787 distinct customers and uses customer_table as a foreign key

Recommendation to drop records from table where customer_id not present in customer table.
The below code will remove the respective records from the customer_logins & login_history tables

DELETE FROM customer_logins
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM customer);

DELETE FROM login_history
WHERE login_id NOT IN (SELECT login_id FROM customer_logins);
